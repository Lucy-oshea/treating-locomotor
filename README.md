# E-learning: Treating Locomotors Disease RDM course

This lesson is a template lesson that uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

## Note about lesson life cycle stage
Although the `config.yaml` states the life cycle stage as pre-alpha, **the template is stable and ready to use**. The life cycle stage is preset to `"pre-alpha"` as this setting is appropriate for new lessons initialised using the template.
